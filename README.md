HTML5 Responsive Website Tutorial by http://www.lingulo.com

This HTML5 website is part of a HTML5 / CSS3 tutorial created by Christoph Anastasiades (http://www.lingulo.com)
Feel free to use it for your personal or commercial projects and/or change it in any way you like.

I would be happy if you put a link to http://www.lingulo.com somewhere on your website to support my work.


What you need to do to make this page work:

- Download Eric Meyer's "Reset CSS" 2.0 (http://www.cssreset.com) and put it into the "css" folder
- Download Lightbox2 (http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and put the folders "css", "images" and "js" into the "lightbox" folder
- Download Modernizr.js (http://modernizr.com/download/), make sure "html5shiv" is checked and put "modernizr.js" into the "js" folder
- Download Respond.min.js (https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) and put it into the "js" folder
- Download jQuery 1.7.2 (http://nienpaper.googlecode.com/files/1.7.2.jquery.min.js) and put it into the "js" folder
- Download Prefix Free (http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) and put it into the "js" folder
- Download SlidesJS (http://www.slidesjs.com/) and put the "jquery.slides.min.js" into the "js" folder
- Find images for the jQuery Slider (should be about 1600px wide) and for all the icons (the icons used in the tutorial are from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/icons8-metro-style-icons-by-visualpharm.1.html)

To minimize the amount of HTTP requests combine all CSS files into one single file.
